# Agar Microchamber Image Processing and Analysis

This repository contains code for processing images of diverse motile organisms, as well as code for analyzing confinement space for a range of organisms of different sizes. The processed images and analysis are included in the publication ['Gotta catch â€˜em all: agar microchambers for high-throughput single cell live imaging'](https://doi.org/10.57844/arcadia-v1bg-6b60). Also, a detailed protocol for making the agar microchambers can be found on protocols.io. [Molding microchambers in agar with PDMS stamps for live imaging](https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.j8nlkwpk1l5r/v1).
