# Agar Microchamber Image Processing and Analysis

This repository contains code for processing images of diverse motile organisms, as well as code for analyzing confinement space for a range of organisms of different sizes. The processed images and analysis are included in the publication [Gotta catch â€˜em all: agar microchambers for high-throughput single cell live imaging](research.arcadiascience.com/pub/resource-agar-microchamber). Also, a detailed protocol for making the agar microchambers can be found on protocols.io. (insert link here).
